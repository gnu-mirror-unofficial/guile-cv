Guile-CV @* a Computer Vision functional programming library for
@uref{@value{UGUILE}, Guile}


@subheading Description

Guile-CV is a Computer Vision function progrmming library for the
@uref{@value{UGUILE}, Guile} Scheme language. Guile-CV is based on
@uref{@value{UVIGRA}, Vigra} (Vision with Generic Algorithms).  It
comprises a direct binding to @uref{@value{UVIGRAC}, vigra_c} (a C
wrapper to a subset of the Vigra library), and a higher level API
written in Guile Scheme.


@subheading What else

Guile-CV is almost entirely written in @uref{@value{UGUILE}, Guile}
Scheme, though for performance reasons, some basic operations are
implemented in C (see libguile-cv if you are interested).  This C code
is kept to the very strict minimum and _not_ part of the API: as Guile
Scheme evolves, targeting an AOT compiler, we may rewrite these in
scheme at any moment.


@subheading Savannah

Guile-CV also has a @uref{@value{UGUILE-CV-SAVANNAH}, Savannah} project
page.


@node Obtaining and Installing Guile-CV
@section Obtaining and Installing Guile-CV

Guile-CV can be obtained from the following archive
@uref{@value{UGUILE-CV-RELEASES}, site}.  The file will be named
guile-cv-version.tar.gz. The current version is @value{VERSION}, so the
file you should grab is:

@tie{}@tie{}@tie{}@tie{}@uref{@value{UGUILE-CV-LATEST}}


@subheading Dependencies

Guile-CV needs the following software to run:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Autoconf >= 2.69
@item
Automake >= 1.14
@item
@uref{@value{UGUILE}, Guile} >= 2.0.13
@item
@uref{@value{UGUILE-LIB}, Guile-Lib} >= 0.2.5
@item 
@uref{@value{UVIGRA}, Vigra} >= 1.11.0
@item
@uref{@value{UVIGRAC}, Vigra_c}

@indentedblock
Vigra_c is a C wrapper [to some of] the Vigra functionality. It is
currently only available by cloning its source code @uref{@value{UGIT},
git} repository: there is no release and no versioning scheme
either@footnote{We do our best to check that the libvigra_c installed
library does contain the required Guile-CV functionalty though, and
these checks are listed as part of our @code{configure} steps}.  But no
big deal, its home page has an 'Installation' section which guides you
step by step.

@strong{Special note:} make sure the directory where
@file{libvigra_c.so} has been installed is 'known', either because it is
defined in @file{/etc/ld.so.conf.d}, or you set the environment variable
@code{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}, otherwise Guile won't find it and
@code{configure} will report an error.
@end indentedblock

@subheading Quickstart

Assuming you have satisfied the dependencies, open a terminal and
proceed with the following steps:

@example
cd <download-path>
tar zxf guile-cv-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
cd guile-cv-@value{VERSION}
./configure [--prefix=/your/prefix]
make
make install
@end example

Happy Guile-CV!

@*
@strong{Notes:}

@enumerate
@item
In the above @code{configure} step, @code{--prefix=/your/prefix} is
optional.  The default value is @code{/usr/local}.  As an example, you
could use

@example
./configure --prefix=/opt
@end example

@item
To install Guile-CV, you must have @code{write permissions} for
@code{$prefix}, Guile's global site and site-ccache directories.
@ifhtml
@*@*
@end ifhtml

@item
Guile-CV's modules are installed in Guile's global site directory.  If
you want to know its location, enter the following expression in a
terminal:

@example
guile -c "(display (%global-site-dir)) (newline)"
@end example

@item
Guile-CV's compiled modules are installed in the Guile's
@code{site-ccache} directory.  If you want to know its location, enter
the following expression in a terminal:

@example
guile -c "(display (%site-ccache-dir)) (newline)"
@end example

@item
Like for any other GNU Tool Chain compatible software, you may install
the documentation locally using @code{make install-info}, @code{make
install-html} and/or @code{make install-pdf}. The documentation is
installed in @code{$prefix/share/doc/guile-cv}
@ifhtml
@*@*
@end ifhtml

@item
Last but not least :), Guile-CV comes with a tests suite, which we
recommend you to run (especially before @ref{Reporting Bugs}):

@example
make check
@end example
@end enumerate
