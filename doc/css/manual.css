  makeinfo convert @deffn and similar functions to something inside
  <blockquote>.  style.css uses italic for blockquote.  This looks
  poor in the Emacs manuals, which make extensive use of @defun (etc).
  In particular, references to function arguments appear as <var>
  inside <blockquote>.  Since <var> is also italic, it makes it
  impossible to distinguish variables.  We could change <var> to
  e.g. bold-italic, or normal, or a different color, but that does not
  look as good IMO.  So we just override blockquote to be non-italic.
