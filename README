** Description

Guile-CV
Image Processing and Analysis in [[http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/][Guile]]
a Computer Vision functional programming library

Guile-CV is based on [[http://ukoethe.github.io/vigra/][Vigra]] (Vigra (Vision with Generic Algorithms),
enhanced with additional algorithms (=Image Textures=, =Delineate=,
=Reconstruction= and many more), all accessible through a =nice=,
=clean= and =easy to use= high level API.

Guile-CV is natively =multi-threaded=, and takes advantage of =multiple
cores=, using high-level and fine grained application-level =parallelism
constructs= available in Guile, based on its support to POSIX threads.

** Latest News

November 2021

GNU Guile-CV version 0.3.0 is released.

Visit the NEWS file or see the [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile-cv.git/tree/NEWS][News]] page for the list of visible changes
since the last release, as well as older news.

** Objective

Guile-CV objective is to be a =robust=, =reliable= and =fast= - Image
Processing and Analysis - Computer Vision functional programming library
for the Guile Scheme language. Guile-CV also wants to be easy to use,
study, modify and extend.

Guile-CV can be used as an educational sofware, a research toolbox but
it can also be used 'in production': Guile-CV is robust, reliable and
fast, and we will make sure Guile-CV remains robust, reliable and fast
as it grows.

Guile-CV also has a [[https://savannah.gnu.org/][Savannah]] project page, [[https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/guile-cv/][here]].
