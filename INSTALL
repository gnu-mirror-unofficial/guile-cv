* Guile-CV

Guile-CV
a Computer Vision functional programming library for Guile

** Dependencies

Guile-CV needs the following software to run:

	Autoconf	>= 2.69
	Automake	>= 1.14
	Guile 		>= 2.0.13	[a]
	Vigra		>= 1.11.0	[b]
	Vigra_c				[c]

	  Vigra_c is a C wrapper [to some of] the Vigra
	  functionality. It is currently only available by cloning its
	  source code git repository: there is no release and no
	  versioning scheme either1. But no big deal, its home page has
	  an ’Installation’ section which guides you step by step.

	  Special note: make sure the directory where libvigra_c.so has
	  been installed is ’known’, either because it is defined in
	  /etc/ld.so.conf.d, or you set the environment variable
	  LD_LIBRARY_PATH, otherwise Guile won’t find it and configure
	  will report an error.

** Quickstart

Till Guile-CV has its Savannah own project pages, releases are
uploaded here:

	http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/grip/guile-cv/

		guile-cv-0.1.3.tar.gz
		guile-cv-0.1.3.tar.gz.sig

		[ GPG Key: A3057AD7
		[ gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys A3057AD7

Assuming you have satisfied the dependencies, open a terminal and
proceed with the following steps:

	cd <download-path>
	tar zxf guile-cv-0.1.3.tar.gz
	cd guile-cv-0.1.3
	./configure [--prefix=/your/prefix]
	make
	make install

Happy Guile-CV!

*** Notes

[1] In the above configure step, --prefix=/your/prefix is optional. The
    default value is /usr/local. As an example, you could use:

		configure --prefix=/opt

[2] To install Guile-CV, you must have write permissions for
    $prefix, Guile’s global site and site-ccache directories.

[3] Guile-CV’s modules are installed in Guile’s global site
    directory. If you want to know its location, enter the following
    expression in a terminal:

		guile -c "(display (%global-site-dir)) (newline)"

[4] Guile-CV’s compiled modules are installed in the Guile’s site-ccache
    directory. If you want to know its location, enter the following
    expression in a terminal:

		guile -c "(display (%site-ccache-dir)) (newline)"

[5] Like for any other GNU Tool Chain compatible software, you may
    install the documentation locally using make install-info, make
    install-html and/or make install-pdf. The documentation is installed
    in $prefix/share/doc/guile-cv

[6] Last but not least :), Guile-CV comes with a tests suite, which we
    recommend you to run (especially before Reporting Bugs):

		make check


* Other configure scripts options

** In a terminal

	./configure --help
