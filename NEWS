** August the xx, 2017

Guile-CV version 0.1.6 is released!

Here is a summary of the changes since version 0.1.5. See GNU Guile-CV's
git summary [1] and git log [2] for a complete description:

	[1] http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile-cv.git
	[2] http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile-cv.git/log/

*** Changes since 0.1.5

**** Interface changes

im-normalize
im-normalize-channel:

  Adding an optional #:key (val 255.0), since we need to be able to
  normalize to specific values in some circumstances, such as, for
  example, to normalize gray level co-occurrence matrices.

f32vector-reduce:

  The arguments order has been changed for 'vector proc default' not
  'proc default vector', because it is the order we use in im-reduce and
  im-reduce-channel - as [almost] all other im-* procedures or methods
  take an image as their first argument.  As a user, it is also a bit
  more naturel, imo at least, to 'reduce image using proc, return
  default if the image is empty'.

**** New interfaces

im-range
im-range-channel
im-min
im-min-channel
im-max
im-max-channel
im-map
im-map-channel
im-reduce
im-reduce-channel
f32vector->s32vector
f32vector-range
s32vector-range
s32vector-min
s32vector-max
s32vector-reduce
s32vector->f32vector


**** Bug fixes

** March the 12th, 2017

Guile-CV version 0.1.3 is released, the next maintenance release for
the 0.1 series.

*** Changes since 0.1.2

Updating headers for a non GNU project style.

Guile-CV is under evaluation to see whether it will be part of GNU.  We
have just been informed that the evaluation is going to take some time:
fine, but we wantto make the project public right now, hence this
release, so the Savannah folks can start the nongnu evaluation.

** March the 9th, 2017

Guile-CV version 0.1.2 is released, the next maintenance release for
the 0.1 series.

	Special note:
	-------------

	The special note written for Guile-CV version 0.1.1 is still
	applicable to this release, see below.

*** Changes since 0.1.1

New procedures:
---------------

	im-copy-channel, im-properties, im-scrap

** Februrary the 18th, 2017

Guile-CV version 0.1.1 is released, the next maintenance release for
the 0.1 series.

	Special note:
	-------------

	(a) that this release is not made 'public' yet, because it is
	still under evaluation to see whether it will be part of GNU or
	not: if yes, fine; if not, I would need to change all
	occurrences of 'Guile-CV' to 'Guile-CV' and all copyright
	notices from 'Free Software Foundation, Inc.' to myself;

	(b) see INSTALL for tarball location during the evaluation
	period.

*** Changes since 0.1.0

Incompatible API change:
------------------------

	Fixing im-flip to refer to a plane rather then an axis: Vigra
    flips (their terminology is reflect, not flip) images and channels
    with respect to an axis, not by reference to a plane. In our
    opinion, this is [unnecessarily] confusing, so we decided to go
    ahead and fix this in Guile-CV.  See the manual (and commit ff62dfa
    for further details and if you are interested to read the source
    code modifications).

New functionality:
------------------

	im-load, im-save: support for RGBA images has been added

	support for image transposition and normalization

New procedures:
---------------

	im-rgba->rgb, im-rgba->grey

	im-transpose, im-transpose-channel, im-normalize,
	im-normalize-channel

	im-add, im-add-channel, im-substract, im-substract-channel,
	im-multiply, im-multiply-channel, im-divide, im-divide-channel

** Special note

The text below as well as 'Older News' are kept as a 'prototype' that we
will use once the project effectively becomes part of GNU, if it does of
course...
